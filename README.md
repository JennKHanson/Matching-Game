## Description

The Matching Game project is a Udacity project as part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

## How to Play

The card deck consists of 16 cards with 8 matching pairs. The object of the game is to match all 8 pairs by flipping two cards at a time. The game is over when all 16 cards are flipped over as part of a matching pair.

## Scoring

The game starts with a rating of three stars. The player loses stars after a number of guesses.

Less than 10 guesses = 3 Stars
10-14 guesses = 2 Stars
15 and more guesses = 1 Star

The game is timed; however, the time that it takes to complete the game does not affect star rating.
